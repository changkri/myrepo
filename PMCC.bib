  abstract = {This review provides an overview of the relationship between ventilation/perfusion ratios and gas exchange in the lung, emphasising basic concepts and relating them to clinical scenarios. For each gas exchanging unit, the alveolar and effluent blood partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide (PO2 and PCO2) are determined by the ratio of alveolar ventilation to blood flow (V'A/Q') for each unit. Shunt and low V'A/Q' regions are two examples of V'A/Q' mismatch and are the most frequent causes of hypoxaemia. Diffusion limitation, hypoventilation and low inspired PO2 cause hypoxaemia, even in the absence of V'A/Q' mismatch. In contrast to other causes, hypoxaemia due to shunt responds poorly to supplemental oxygen. Gas exchanging units with little or no blood flow (high V'A/Q' regions) result in alveolar dead space and increased wasted ventilation, i.e. less efficient carbon dioxide removal. Because of the respiratory drive to maintain a normal arterial PCO2, the most frequent result of wasted ventilation is increased minute ventilation and work of breathing, not hypercapnia. Calculations of alveolar-arterial oxygen tension difference, venous admixture and wasted ventilation provide quantitative estimates of the effect of V'A/Q' mismatch on gas exchange. The types of V'A/Q' mismatch causing impaired gas exchange vary characteristically with different lung diseases.},

We here propose an innovative method in epidemiology that is derived from social sciences: state sequence analysis (SSA). This method takes into account the chronology of care consumption and allows for identification of specific patterns. A process for using SSA in the health area is proposed and discussed. The main steps are: data coding, measurement of dissimilarities between sequences (focusing on optimal matching methods and the choice of related costs), and application of a clustering method to obtain a typology of sequence patterns. As an example of its use in the health area, SSA was employed to analyse care pathways of a random sample of patients with multiple sclerosis. This sample has been selected from the main French healthcare database covering the period 2007 to 2013 (n\,=\,1 000). A five-cluster typology was obtained which allowed distinction of care co...},

Addressed features include the description of sets of sequences by means of transversal aggregated views, the computation of longitudinal characteristics of individual sequences and the measure of pairwise dissimilarities. Special emphasis is put on the multiple ways of visualizing sequences. The core element of the package is the state se- quence object in which we store the set of sequences together with attributes such as the alphabet, state labels and the color palette. The functions can then easily retrieve this information to ensure presentation homogeneity across all printed and graphical displays. The article also demonstrates how TraMineR 's outcomes give access to advanced analyses such as clustering and statistical modeling of sequence data.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Non-intubated intensive care patients commonly receive supplemental oxygen by high-flow face mask (HFFM), simple face mask (FM) and nasal prongs (NP) during their ICU admission. However, high-flow nasal prongs (HFNP) offer considerable performance capabilities that may sufficiently meet all their oxygen therapy requirements. 

STUDY AIMS To assess the feasibility, safety and cost-effectiveness of introducing a protocol in which HFNP was the primary oxygen delivery device for non-intubated intensive care patients. 

METHOD Prospective 4-week before-and-after study (6 months apart) for all adult patients admitted to a 22-bed tertiary ICU in Melbourne, Australia. 

RESULTS 117 patients (57 before, 60 after) were included: 86 (73.5\%) received mechanical ventilation. Feasibility revealed a significant reduction in HFFM (52.6–0\%, p.001), FM (35.1–8.3\%, p=.002) and NP (75.4–36.7\%, p.001) use and an increase in HFNP use (31.6–81.7\%, p.05) during the after period. Following extubation, there was a significant reduction in HFFM use (65.7\% vs. 0\%, p.05) and an increase HFNP use (8.6\% vs. 87.5\%, p.05). Costing was in favour of the after period with a consumable cost saving per patient (AUD \$32.56 vs. \$17.62, p.05). During the after period, more patients were discharged from ICU with HFNP than during the before period (5 vs. 33 patients, p.05) and fewer patients (5 vs. 14 patients) used three or more oxygen delivery devices. Safety outcomes demonstrated no significant difference in the number of intubations, re-intubations, readmissions or non-invasive ventilation use between the two time periods. 

CONCLUSIONS Using HFNP as the primary oxygen delivery method for non-intubated intensive care patients was feasible, appeared safe, and the oxygen device costs were reduced. The findings of our single-centre study support further multi-centre evaluations of HFNP therapy protocols in non-ventilated intensive care patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Measuring patient satisfaction after anaesthesia care is complex. The existing patient satisfaction questionnaires are limited and omit aspects of patient satisfaction, such as professional competence, information provision, service, and staff–patient relationship. The aim of our study was to develop a valid and reliable self-reported multidimensional questionnaire assessing patient satisfaction that included these issues. 

METHODS The development of the Leiden Perioperative care Patient Satisfaction questionnaire (LPPSq) was as follows: expert consultation, construction of the pilot questionnaire, pilot study, statistical analysis of the results of the pilot study (validity, reliability, and factor analysis), compilation of the definitive questionnaire, main study, and repeated statistical analysis (validity, reliability, and factor analysis). The overall patient satisfaction is expressed by the mean satisfaction score. 

RESULTS Three hundred and eighty-two patients consented to participate in the study; 80.4\% of the patients (n=307) completed the questionnaire. The LPPSq isolated three dimensions: information (Cronbach's α=0.82), fear and concern (Cronbach's α=0.69), and staff–patient relationship (Cronbach's α=0.94). Patient satisfaction with perioperative care was not directly dependent on the outcomes of anaesthesia but how patients were approached and the amount of information they received. Age (P=0.001), gender (P=0.001), work situation (P=0.003), and specialty (P=0.017) were the characteristics most influencing patient satisfaction. 

CONCLUSIONS We developed the LPPSq questionnaire to measure patient satisfaction with perioperative care, of which anaesthesia care is an important element. In this study, information provision and the relationship between staff and patient were the major determinants of patient satisfaction.},

  abstract = {In this article, the authors define a methodological framework for analyzing the relationship between state sequences and covariates. Inspired by the principles of analysis of variance, this approach looks at how the covariates explain the discrepancy of the sequences. The authors use the pairwise dissimilarities between sequences to determine the discrepancy, which makes it possible to develop a series of statistical significance–based analysis tools. They introduce generalized simple and multifactor discrepancy-based methods to test for differences between groups, a pseudo-R2 for measuring the strength of sequence-covariate associations, a generalized Levene statistic for testing differences in the within-group discrepancies, as well as tools and plots for studying the evolution of the differences along the time frame and a regression tree method for discovering the most significant discriminant covariates and their interactions. In addition, the authors extend all methods to account for case weights. T...},

  abstract = {Patients undergoing invasive cardiac catheterization (ICC) can experience anxiety and pain. A common practice in the United States is to administer benzodiazepines and opioids for conscious sedation to relieve these symptoms. Music may reduce anxiety and pain perception. We sought to evaluate the role of music in lieu of pharmacotherapy for conscious sedation during elective ICC. A retrospective data analysis was performed on patients who underwent ICC and received music therapy ± intravenous sedation/analgesics based on patient's preference compared with control patients who were offered and received intravenous sedation/analgesics based on patient's preference. A total of 161 patients were analyzed, 49 in the music arm, and 112 in the control arm. Baseline characteristics were similar in the 2 groups except that the rate of drug addiction, back pain, post-traumatic stress disorder, and hearing loss were higher in the control group when compared with the music arm. 42 (86\%) of the patients in the music group and 29 (26\%) of the control group received no sedation or analgesia in the periprocedural period. The average dose of midazolam (0.7 mg vs 0.1 mg, p 0.0001) and fentanyl (39.5 mcg vs 3 mcg, p 0.0001) was higher in the control than the music arm, respectively. 42 (86\%) of patients receiving music therapy believed music was helpful in reducing their stress/anxiety levels. In conclusion, music may serve as adjunctive/alternative intervention to pharmacotherapy in relieving anxiety and stress for patients undergoing elective ICC.},

  abstract = {Advances in radiology and imaging technologies and the emergent scope of practice have led to the capacity to provide services to a growing population of high-acuity patients with comorbid conditions. These procedures are often performed with the radiology nurse administering procedural sedation. Monitoring patients is challenging due to certain patient conditions and the unique environment, that is, the radiology procedure suite. The addition of capnography monitoring, along with standard monitoring, is a valuable modality that provides a continuous objective assessment of the patient's ventilatory status even when direct visualization of the patient is compromised. The purpose of this article is to provide clinical practice recommendations for the use of capnography by procedural sedation nurses outside the operating room setting.},

  abstract = {Study objective We determine whether the use of capnography is associated with a decreased incidence of hypoxic events than standard monitoring alone during emergency department (ED) sedation with propofol. Methods Adults underwent ED propofol sedation with standard monitoring (pulse oximetry, cardiac and blood pressure) and capnography and were randomized into a group in which treating physicians had access to the capnography and a blinded group in which they did not. All patients received supplemental oxygen (3 L/minute) and opioids greater than 30 minutes before. Propofol was dosed at 1.0 mg/kg, followed by 0.5 mg/kg as needed. Capnographic and SpO2 data were recorded electronically every 5 seconds. Hypoxia was defined as SpO2 less than 93\%; respiratory depression, as end tidal CO2 (etco2) greater than 50 mm Hg, etco2 change from baseline of 10\%, or loss of the waveform. Results One hundred thirty-two subjects were evaluated and included in the final analysis. We observed hypoxia in 17 of 68 (25\%) subjects with capnography and 27 of 64 (42\%) with blinded capnography (P=.035; difference 17\%; 95\% confidence interval 1.3\% to 33\%). Capnography identified all cases of hypoxia before onset (sensitivity 100\%; specificity 64\%), with the median time from capnographic evidence of respiratory depression to hypoxia 60 seconds (range 5 to 240 seconds). Conclusion In adults receiving ED propofol sedation, the addition of capnography to standard monitoring reduced hypoxia and provided advance warning for all hypoxic events.},
